# OBS-Scripts
A collection of scripts for OBS that I use/have used as part of my production setup

## Installation Instructions
- Download the individual script that you want to use
- Open OBS (Version 27.2.1 or later is recommended)
- Go to Tools/Scripts
- Click the '+' button to add a script. Navigate and select the script that you downloaded
- Set any desired parameters for the script on the right
- Check the Script Log for any errors

If you run into any issues with the scripts, you can contact me on Discord (Mindez#0001), but support may be limited because these scripts were generally written with a very specific setup in mind.
